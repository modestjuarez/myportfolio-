      <h2>My Portfolio: Modest Juarez's Webapp</h2>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p>I'm a computer science student that has an interest in webapplications</p><br>
      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>Hmmm, tough question. I'd say that I'm whoever I need to be in any given situation.</p>
                    As the firtborn in my family, and the first to speak and understand english, I learned early on the importance of research
              I was always a very introverted kid who was too shy to ask for help so I struggled constantly in school, especally in my ESL classes, but
              I grew up in the age of technology so once I was taught how to use a computer, my independence increased dramatically, and I flourished educationally
              By the time I was in 7th grade, I was handling all the calls to our internet service provider, learning about pinging a website, and translating for my parents in a business setting.
              I was still shy around kids my age but more comfortable around adults. I still had trouble understanding and explaining anything too technical but I was the household go to tech person.
              By the time I was in high school I was the person at home that would help with any calls to the companies that provided our public utilities like water, gas, and electricity.
              This eary independence and self-reliece made me into the perpn I am today. I'd say I'm eccentric in taste but overall a well rounded person.
              I'm motivating when I need to be and supportive when I don't. I can also be a leader in a situation where there is no other viable candidate.
          </p>
      <h3>What projects have I been a part of?</h3>
          <p>During my second year at my local community college, I joined the NASA Ascend High-Altitude Ballooning Project, where I was a volunteed for the fall of 2018 
              semester and then a full-fledged team member in the spring. I did not have much experience coding in c++ and I'd just started learning Java while I could not
              create any type of intricate code, I was able to initialize some sensors. My biggest accomplishment while I was part of the group was to be able to create the
              custom power distribution board for our spring payload. I was also part of the NASA Community College Aerospace Scholars (NCAS) program which allowed me to visit the 
              Armstrong Flight Research Center at the Edwards Airforce base in Lancaster, CA for a week that summer. Since transfering to Arizona State University, I've been a participant
              of two hackathons where my team won first place at the frist hackathon with an Alexa app that would help the environment. I've been able to attend different conferences around
              the country that have strengthened my interest in the field. I've had the oppotunity to mentor other young girls in the STEM field. 
              I've also studyied abroad in Japan, Korea, and the Czech Republic which have been amazing experiences. They were short summer programs but the experience meant so much to me.
              My parents have never traveled outside of Arizona since they arrived here so I thought I would also never have the funds or opportunity to travel.
